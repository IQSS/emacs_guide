# Install Emacs Packages {.sec-opening}

Now we are going to open Emacs for the first time. This will install a lot of Emacs packages for you, almost automatically. 

In the bottom, a message will ask you to press "y" to install packages. Please do. A lot of packages will load again. 

After some time, another message will pop up again asking you to press "y" to install a few more packages. Again, please do.

This may take a bit of time to install of these packages (~5 minutes).

At the end, you may or may not get a message that a package is deprecated. This should not be an issue, and it should not appear again when you open Emacs in the future.

Now please ***close out of Emacs and reopen it***.
