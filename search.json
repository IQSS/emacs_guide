Please stay updated as we prepare materials for Microsoft users.\nIn preparation for installing Emacs, there are other programs that we also recommend to install. Please refer to our documentation for useful programs to install prior to Emacs. This page includes links to external download sites for programs such as R, MikTex, and Git.\nIn fact, if you do not install some of these (or if you have not previously installed some of these), you may run into problems when loading our Emacs configuration. For instance, you will likely need Git already installed in order for your Copilot integration to work.\nFor this process, we will teach you how to use the command line in the terminal. However, there will also be external links for many of the download options if you are not wholly comfortable in the terminal, or find yourself running into problems.",

    "text": "There are a few programs that we will need to install: Homebrew, node, ispell, and gnu-tar.\nHomebrew is necessary as MacOS’s package manager. This will allow you to install various programs via the command line. Node.js, ispell, and gnu-tar are all dependencies that are needed in order to integrate with Copilot.\nTo do so, please open your Terminal. (If you don’t know where this is: Finder &gt; Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal).\n\nNow type: /bin/bash -c “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)”\nPress enter. Follow the instructions. It will likely give you a message to copy two lines of code. Copy and paste the first and press enter. When that is done, copy and paste the second and press enter. Make sure to replace “yourusername” with your actual username.\n\nThe first: (echo; echo ‘eval “$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)“’) &gt;&gt; /Users/yourusername/.zprofile\nThe second: eval “$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)”\n\n\nOnce Homebrew is installed, we can now install the three dependencies in your terminal. One by one, please copy and paste the following lines and execute separately (by pressing return after each).\n\nbrew install gnu-tar\nbrew install node\nbrew install ispell\n\nYou should now be done!\nIf you run into any problems installing these, please refer to documentation online for Homebrew, gnu-tar, node.js, and ispell.",
